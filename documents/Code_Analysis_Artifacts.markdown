## Customization and Usage Guidelines

- **Customization**: Each artifact is designed to be flexible, allowing SMEs to incorporate client-specific data, such as codebase details, industry regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, PCI-DSS for finance), and strategic priorities. Use tools like SonarQube for code quality, Dependabot for dependencies, or OWASP ZAP for security scans to generate accurate data.
- **SME Involvement**: Engage SMEs from development, DevOps, security, and business teams to validate content. For example, front-end developers should review UI metrics, while security analysts should verify vulnerability scans.
- **Tools**:
  - **Code Analysis**: SonarQube, ESLint, Checkmarx
  - **Dependency Mapping**: Dependabot, Snyk, Graphviz
  - **Performance Testing**: JMeter, New Relic
  - **Diagramming**: Visio, Lucidchart, Draw.io
  - **Project Management**: Jira, ServiceNow
- **Audience-Specific Usage**:
  - **C-suite**: Use the Code Modernization Roadmap and Vendor Tools Assessment for strategic discussions, focusing on costs, benefits, and risks.
  - **PMO**: Leverage the Code Modernization Roadmap and Technical Debt Report for planning and tracking.
  - **Technical Team**: Use detailed reports (e.g., Front-End, Back-End, Security) for implementation planning.
  - **DevOps**: Focus on Dependency Map, Integrations Analysis, and Performance Analysis for infrastructure and deployment.
  - **Security Team**: Prioritize Security Analysis Report for compliance and vulnerability remediation.

## Key Considerations

- **Industry-Agnostic Design**: Artifacts are standardized to apply across industries, but SMEs should adjust for specific needs (e.g., GDPR compliance for European clients, scalability for e-commerce).
- **Iterative Refinement**: Update artifacts based on client feedback and code analysis findings during the discovery phase.
- **Visualization**: Use diagrams (e.g., dependency maps, data flows) to enhance clarity for non-technical stakeholders.
- **Actionable Insights**: Each artifact includes recommendations to guide modernization, such as refactoring priorities or vendor tool replacements.

This set of artifacts ensures a comprehensive, standardized code analysis that supports a client’s modernization journey, delivering clear insights for all stakeholders.
